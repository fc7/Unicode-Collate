This is the TODO list for the unofficial fork of the CPAN module Unicode::Collate
on http://github.com/fc7/Unicode-Collate

* Expand the test suite. Use Test::More.
* Make sure all tests based on
  http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/5.2.0/CollationTest.zip
  pass (currently they do not).
* Benchmark this fork (PP and XS) against v0.52 on CPAN (PP and XS).
* Update to UCA Revision 20 (the code currently reflects Revision 18 == Unicode 5.1.0).
  NB: changes from 18 to 20 are mostly clarifications.
* Implement collation with context (used in CLDR for Japanese)
* Implement all parameters of UCA §5.1 "Parametric tailoring"
  THESE ARE NOT YET IMPLEMENTED:
    - caseLevel
    - caseFirst (partial: only caseFirst="upper" is accounted for –
      it is the only one to occur in CLDR as of v1.8)
    - numeric
    - hiraganaQuaternary
    - variableTop
* Also for "normalization" the current behaviour needs careful review in light
  of UTS#10 and UTS#35 §5.14.3.  Allow more than one locale (assuming their
* rules are non-conflicting: eg ['fr', 'ja']).
