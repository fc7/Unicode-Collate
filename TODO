This is the TODO list for the unofficial fork of the CPAN module Unicode::Collate
on http://github.com/fc7/Unicode-Collate

* Update to UCA Revision 20 (the code currently reflects Revision 14 == Unicode 4.1.0)
* Add support for locales based on the CLDR tailorings
* Expand the test suite. Especially add tests based on
  http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/5.2.0/CollationTest.zip
  (the latter is now done).
* Benchmark this fork (PP and XS) against v0.52 on CPAN (PP and XS).
