This is the TODO list for the unofficial fork of the CPAN module Unicode::Collate
on http://github.com/fc7/Unicode-Collate

* Update to UCA Revision 20 (the code currently reflects Revision 18 == Unicode 5.1.0)
* Add support for locales based on the CLDR tailorings.
  -Refactor tools/generate_cldr.pl
  -Perhaps use Template::Tiny to generate the U::C::CLDR modules
* Expand the test suite. Use Test::More.
* Make sure all tests based on
  http://www.unicode.org/Public/UCA/5.2.0/CollationTest.zip
  pass (currently they do not).
* Benchmark this fork (PP and XS) against v0.52 on CPAN (PP and XS).
